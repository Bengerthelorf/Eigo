<blockquote>
<p>I believe that campuses can be opened to the public, but access should be restricted to certain areas and subject to daily quotas. Schools are inherently meant to be places of learning for students and teaching for educators. The disruption to the normal order of teaching due to campus openness is evident. Recent incidents have already significantly impacted this openness.</p>
<p>For instance, a few days ago at Wuhan University, visitors trampled on lawns under maintenance despite clear signage; they crowded the cherry blossom avenue to the point of impassability; there were instances of visitors driving and honking within the campus, leading to altercations when students intervened; and even more extreme, defecation at the entrance of the literature department... These events have only increased societal unease about campus openness. Imagine the desperation of rushing to catch a school bus, needing to eat within 20 minutes after class, only to find tourists queuing up at the cafeteria.</p>
<p>It's observable that even 'unfenced' foreign universities typically only open facilities like gyms, museums, concert halls, and historical sites to the public. Core areas like academic buildings and dormitories remain closed, with access limited to specific times or holidays. For example, Harvard University organizes campus tours mainly on weekends to maintain a quiet academic environment. I find this to be a good balance.</p>
<p>You might argue that since schools are public spaces built with taxpayers' money, they should belong to all taxpayers. Using taxpayer funds to serve only a minority could be seen as a direct insult to the act of taxation. However, as universities built with tax funds, there is indeed a societal responsibility and an obligation to be open. But opening the entire university to tourists disrupts the normal teaching order, affecting the university's primary public service roles—teaching and research. If these primary functions are not fulfilled, isn't that a greater insult to taxpayers? It's like throwing money into nowhere.</p>
<p>In response, you might counter that if tourists can't observe students in class, it would greatly diminish the promotion of academic atmosphere. My rebuttal remains the same: schools should prioritize teaching and research, not servicing tourists. If an academic atmosphere is needed, specialized public classes or museum access, like Fudan University's Human Body Museum, could be provided. This would achieve a balance between both objectives.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I believe that partial, rather than full, campus openness is the most appropriate choice at present.</p>
