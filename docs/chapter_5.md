| Problem | Yunnan elephants' migration due to habitat destruction. |
| Causes | Since 2019, persistent high temperatures and drought conditions have led to the northward migration of elephant herds. The extreme dry heat has caused a sharp decrease in herbaceous and shrubby vegetation within the reserves, forcing the elephants to set off. Moreover, due to the high temperatures and low rainfall, 57 rivers within the province may dry up, affecting the availability of drinking water. The expansion of human activities, such as commercial forest planting and the replacement of natural forests with rubber and tea plantations, has also led to the shrinking and fragmentation of elephant habitats. |
| Consequences | The elephants embarked on an unplanned northern journey. |
| Control | The Chinese government has accelerated the introduction of protection measures for Asian elephants. Experts have been calling for the expansion of conservation areas, the transformation of forest plantations to ensure food supply for elephant herds, the development of ecological corridors and food source bases, and the establishment of cross-border conservation areas. Additionally, a national park for Asian elephants is being established. |
