> Daniel Goleman's emotional intelligence theory outlines five components of EI: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills.
>
> For me, I perceive my deficiency lies in self-regulation. I am easily swayed by external environments and can become emotional, even small things can sometimes cause disproportionately alter my mood. At times, just a glance at the cover of a book can stir emotions within me, prompting me to pen in my journal: "Beside my hand rests a book, its origin unknown, its presence on my desk a mystery. Its cover, a watercolor painting, where dusk intertwines with the azure night, adorned with crystalline stars and a comet trailing its lengthy tail. The boy seated at the center, listening to a CD, humming a tune, before him lies an eternally unfinished tale." Such whimsical thoughts can overwhelm my emotions, rendering me unwilling to talk people, leading to descriptions of me as aloof â€” friendly yet not intimate. However, this is not my true nature. In light of these misunderstandings caused by my lack of self-regulation, I concede that change might indeed be necessary, and I believe I roughly know how to transform.
>
> Of course, change does not mean that I need to give up my essence. Everyone has their own rhythm and method to feel the world and experience life. I may not be the shiniest in a crowd, but you can hear me by my side. I may be moved by a painting, a song, or a book, and this is my unique way of sensing the world. By remaining authentic, those who understand me will naturally gravitate towards my life. I need not conform to others' perceptions of perfection; I need to become a better version of myself.
>
> To become a better self, I will endeavor to enhance my self-regulation. When emotions fluctuate, I will take deep breaths and try to look at the problem from different angles; I will journal, recording my genuine feelings and thoughts, to gain a clearer self-understanding; I will communicate with trusted friends, whose viewpoints and advice often illuminate alternative possibilities.
>
> Admittedly, this journey requires time and may encounter setbacks, but I am confident that, with the passage of time, I will grow stronger and more self-assured. Ultimately, I aspire to elevate my emotional intelligence and become a better version of myself.
