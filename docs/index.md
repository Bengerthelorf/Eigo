If this is the first time you've seen this Stop error screen, restart your computer. If this screen appears again, follow these steps:

Check to make sure any new hardware or software is properly installed.

If you're savvy with a computer, pop open your browserâ€”be it Edge, Chrome, or some other wonderfully weird thing, whatever, you're already surfing the web.

Next up, fire up this link in your browser: [https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/resolving-blue-screen-errors-in-windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZKtZxSi2xw), and let it spin for 20 loops.

If problems continue, hop on over to this linky-winky: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/performance/stop-error-or-blue-screen-error-troubleshooting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-1_NymodG8), and give it a whirl for 20 rounds. No luck? Maybe it's time for a ringtone remix with that catchy tune from the video. And if that doesn't do the trick, well, it might be time to scoot over to the hardware manufacturers for a fix.
