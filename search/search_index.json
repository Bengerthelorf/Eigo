Text I believe that campuses can be opened to the public, but access should be restricted to certain areas and subject to daily quotas. Schools are inherently meant to be places of learning for students and teaching for educators. The disruption to the normal order of teaching due to campus openness is evident. Recent incidents have already significantly impacted this openness. For instance, a few days ago at Wuhan University, visitors trampled on lawns under maintenance despite clear signage; they crowded the cherry blossom avenue to the point of impassability; there were instances of visitors driving and honking within the campus, leading to altercations when students intervened; and even more extreme, defecation at the entrance of the literature department... These events have only increased societal unease about campus openness. Imagine the desperation of rushing to catch a school bus, needing to eat within 20 minutes after class, only to find tourists queuing up at the cafeteria. It's observable that even 'unfenced' foreign universities typically only open facilities like gyms, museums, concert halls, and historical sites to the public. Core areas like academic buildings and dormitories remain closed, with access limited to specific times or holidays. For example, Harvard University organizes campus tours mainly on weekends to maintain a quiet academic environment. I find this to be a good balance. You might argue that since schools are public spaces built with taxpayers' money, they should belong to all taxpayers. Using taxpayer funds to serve only a minority could be seen as a direct insult to the act of taxation. However, as universities built with tax funds, there is indeed a societal responsibility and an obligation to be open. But opening the entire university to tourists disrupts the normal teaching order, affecting the university's primary public service roles\u2014teaching and research. If these primary functions are not fulfilled, isn't that a greater insult to taxpayers? It's like throwing money into nowhere. In response, you might counter that if tourists can't observe students in class, it would greatly diminish the promotion of academic atmosphere. My rebuttal remains the same: schools should prioritize teaching and research, not servicing tourists. If an academic atmosphere is needed, specialized public classes or museum access, like Fudan University's Human Body Museum, could be provided. This would achieve a balance between both objectives. In conclusion, I believe that partial, rather than full, campus openness is the most appropriate choice at present.","title":"\u2689 ASSIGNMENT_2"},{"location":"chapter_2/#assignment_2","text":"","title":"ASSIGNMENT_2"},{"location":"chapter_2/#hw_2","text":"Your browser does not support the audio element.","title":"HW_2"},{"location":"chapter_2/#text","text":"I believe that campuses can be opened to the public, but access should be restricted to certain areas and subject to daily quotas.

Daniel Goleman's emotional intelligence theory outlines five components of EI: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. For me, I perceive my deficiency lies in self-regulation. I am easily swayed by external environments and can become emotional, even small things can sometimes disproportionately alter my mood. At times, just a glance at the cover of a book can stir emotions within me, prompting me to pen in my journal: \"Beside my hand rests a book, its origin unknown, its presence on my desk a mystery. Its cover, a watercolor painting, where dusk intertwines with the azure night, adorned with crystalline stars and a comet trailing its lengthy tail. The boy seated at the center, listening to a CD, humming a tune, before him lies an eternally unfinished tale.\" Such whimsical thoughts can overwhelm my emotions, rendering me unwilling to talk to people, leading to descriptions of me as aloof \u2014 friendly yet not intimate. However, this is not my true nature. In light of these misunderstandings caused by my lack of self-regulation, I concede that change might indeed be necessary, and I believe I roughly know how to transform. Of course, change does not mean that I need to give up my essence. Everyone has their own rhythm and method to feel the world and experience life. I may not be the shiniest in a crowd, but by my side, you can still hear my voice. I may be moved by a painting, a song, or a book, and this is my unique way of sensing the world. By remaining authentic, those who understand me will naturally gravitate towards my life. I need not conform to others' perceptions of perfection; I need to become a better version of myself. To become a better self, I will endeavor to enhance my self-regulation. When emotions fluctuate, I will take deep breaths and try to look at the problem from different angles; I will journal, recording my genuine feelings and thoughts, to gain a clearer self-understanding; I will communicate with trusted friends, whose viewpoints and advice often illuminate alternative possibilities. Admittedly, this journey requires time and may encounter setbacks, but I am confident that, with the passage of time, I will grow stronger and more self-assured. Ultimately, I aspire to elevate my emotional intelligence and become a better version of myself.","title":"\u2686 ASSIGNMENT_3"},{"location":"chapter_3/#assignment_3","text":"","title":"ASSIGNMENT_3"},{"location":"chapter_3/#hw_3","text":"Your browser does not support the audio element.

I believe that Western culture and globalization have largely 'determined' the cultural forms and ways of thinking in our modern lives. Modern society is a society of ideologies, a society of symbols. Power, through Foucault's panopticism, links power and knowledge together, embedding social discipline into every individual participating in modern society. From this perspective, we are inevitably also thinking in the ways of Western culture and globalization. You might argue why the part about social discipline is all about Western culture? Indeed, we can still see many deep-rooted influences from Chinese culture, whether they are excellent or absolutely bad. However, when our economic foundation and the entire social structure are based on Western culture, our ways of thinking and cultural forms are inevitably greatly influenced by Western culture, an influence that far exceeds the remnants of Chinese culture. Here, I would like to mention a book\u2014\"Remaking 'Patients'\"\u2014which studies the beginning of China's modern history through the introduction of Western medicine into China and the Chinese body's attitude towards Western medicine. There is a very impactful assertion in the book: \"The moment the first scalpel of Western medicine cut into the body of a Chinese person, it became an event of modernity.\" When the Chinese accepted modernity physically, it meant the collapse of the traditional, rigid ethical values of filial piety\u2014'The body, hair and skin, all have been received from the parents, and so one doesn\u2019t dare damage them\u2014that is the beginning of xiao.' It also meant that the Chinese accepted modernity in their minds, stepping into a new era with both body and mind, and realizing the process of modernization. When people's ideas begin to waver, it signifies the start of a new historical phase. Therefore, it is clear that the foundation of modern society is built on Western rather than Eastern culture. To this end, we can also conduct a simple thought experiment to demonstrate: that is, traditional Chinese society was built upon the clan system, which in turn was based on the patriarchal system of authority. It established its authority by denying the individual's body, whereas in modern society, there is an affirmative attitude towards the body, as seen in Foucault's biopolitics, not to mention that the symbolic consumption itself is an affirmation of human animal instincts. These relationships can easily be found in today's society. Regarding the remnants of traditional Chinese culture, in terms of excellent culture, we have many outstanding literary and artistic works, and countless excellent poems that are still sung today. In terms of the dregs, the objectification of women under the traditional patriarchal system, presented as transactions in marriage, is an example. These can essentially be summed up as: the rootless duckweed of traditional Chinese literature and arts, or the old, obstinate, outdated concepts. We need to abandon these outdated social relations and embrace new ones, while continuing to strive for the protection of our excellent cultural heritage.","title":"\u2687 ASSIGNMENT_4"},{"location":"chapter_4/#assignment_4","text":"","title":"ASSIGNMENT_4"},{"location":"chapter_4/#hw_4","text":"Your browser does not support the audio element.

Causes Since 2019, persistent high temperatures and drought conditions have led to the northward migration of elephant herds. The extreme dry heat has caused a sharp decrease in herbaceous and shrubby vegetation within the reserves, forcing the elephants to set off. Moreover, due to the high temperatures and low rainfall, 57 rivers within the province may dry up, affecting the availability of drinking water. The expansion of human activities, such as commercial forest planting and the replacement of natural forests with rubber and tea plantations, has also led to the shrinking and fragmentation of elephant habitats. Consequences A herd of Yunnan elephants embarked on a northward trek without a clear destination. Control The Chinese government has accelerated the introduction of protection measures for Asian elephants. Experts have been calling for the expansion of conservation areas, the transformation of forest plantations to ensure food supply for elephant herds, the development of ecological corridors and food source bases, and the establishment of cross-border conservation areas.
